      <h2>Dreamy hangs for the plant obsessed...</h2>
      <p>Hello my fellow perpetual plant people and obsessive propagators!</p>
      <p>These projects were born of a lack of surface area for plants. I am constantly running out of places to put them, while constantly propagating. These are all designed to be unique, but simple and beautiful on their own, while enhancing to spaces of all sizes. Each crystal or disco ball is bound carefully into the hanger so it is not meant to be taken out and is stable in its place.</p>
      <p>I am completely and totally open to custom orders for various size and complexities so feel free to send me an email to get something started to suit you specifically! If you'd like me to create one with a specific crystal, I'd love to talk about it and we'll see what we can create! Please bear in mind that the cost of the crystal for me will always impact the overall price of a finished hanger. Head on over to the Contact page to get in touch!</p>
